Discuss the various applications of Stacks. Also write an Algorithm to PUSH and POP an ELement into the Stack.

Ans: Stacks can be used for expression evaluation. Stacks can be used to check parenthesis matching in an expression. Stacks can be used for Conversion from one form of expression to another. Stacks can be used for Memory Management. Stack data structures are used in backtracking problems.

PUSH Operation:
begin procedure push: stack, data
   if stack is full
      return null
   endif

   top ← top + 1
   stack[top] ← data
end procedure

POP Operation:
begin procedure pop: stack
   if stack is empty
      return null
   endif
   
   data ← stack[top]
   top ← top - 1
   return data
end procedure
